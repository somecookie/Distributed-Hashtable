# Distributed-Hashtable
This project was done with the collaboration of @AntonRagot as part of a class at the Swiss Technical Instiute in Lausanne.

# Description of the project
This is a distributed hash table in C based on Amazonâ€™s Dynamo which includes the implementations of servers that can handle the requested operations made by several clients and the implementation of a network layer that deals with the communications between the servers and the client (all done in parallel).
